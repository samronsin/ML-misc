ScrapingMachine
===============

Time Series data scraping in Python.

TODO:
  - improve the HTML parsing process (no more regular expressions!)
  - store the temporary data in a database (or the addresses to the time series)
  - update the data regularly (at least 3 measurements a day for each project)
  - move the definitive data for each finished series in a second database
